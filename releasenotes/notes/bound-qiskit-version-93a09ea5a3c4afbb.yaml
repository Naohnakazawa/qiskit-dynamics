    This version of Qiskit Dynamics requires ``qiskit <= 1.3``, as a result of the removal of
    ``qiskit.pulse`` in Qiskit 2.0. Due to the minimal dependance of Qiskit Dynamics on other parts
    of Qiskit, any workflow not utilizing ``qiskit.pulse`` should still be compatible with the
    latest version of Qiskit.

    In addition to the above, while Qiskit Dynamics does not formally depend on Qiskit Experiments,
    the :class:`.DynamicsBackend` will now only work with Qiskit Experiments `0.8` releases.
