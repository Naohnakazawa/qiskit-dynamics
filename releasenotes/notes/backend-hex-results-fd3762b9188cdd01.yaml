upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`.DynamicsBackend` now returns results in hexadecimal. Previously, results were returned
    in ``n``-ary, where ``n`` is the value of the ``max_outcome_level`` option. The hexadecimal
    values are generated by calling ``hex(int(x, n))``, where ``n`` is ``max_outcome_level`` and
    ``x`` is the original ``n``-ary value.
  - |
    Corresponding to the above change, the default behaviour for ``max_outcome_level`` is now to
    treat a ``None`` value as ``1``.
